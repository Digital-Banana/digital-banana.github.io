## About Me
Welcome to my blog and portfolio. My name is Kenny Jeurissen. I have a Bachelor of Science at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences. My focus:

* Data analysis
* Data visualization
* Visual and user interface design

I work at the Human Data Interaction Lab and LARKinfolab at the Brightlands Smart Services Campus in Heerlen, the Netherlands. In a nutshell, I try to improve the way humans see data. With a background in graphic design I also build user interfaces for these data visualizations when necessary.

When I'm not playing with data or doodling visual design ideas, I'm usually reading a book or spending my time at the gym. I like to read science-fiction, fantasy, cyberpunk and, well... data visualization and design. :)

Find out more about me from the social media links in the left. Find me on LinkedIn, Twitter, or send me an email.

### Techie Stuff
I work with R for data analysis and D3 for high quality interactive graphs. I primarily work with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and MAXON Cinema 4D and Autodesk Maya for user interface and visual design.
