## Welcome!
Welcome to my blog. This is hopefully the first post of many. In this blog I plan to talk about visual design, or specifically: data visualization, data analysis and user interface design. 

I created this blog in order to spread my knowledge, to learn new things and to get better at what I do. Having recently finished my Bachelor's Degree, I think this is a good way to continue learning. It's time to work on *real* projects now.

What I have planned for the remainder of 2019 -- as there are only three and a half months left in 2019 -- is to get this blog up and running properly and post something new at least twice a week. I'd like to explore and create visualizations specifically for this blog, but also talk about good creations and good creators I find in the wild.

Together with my new job, running this blog and doing my own thing in my spare time I'll be busy for quite a while. :)

### Categories
I plan to talk about a number of different categories related to the aforementioned disciplinaries. Right now I have a couple in mind, which can be filed under:

* Fundamentals
* Case studies (breakdowns, or dissecting a design's numerous individual parts)
* Statistics (data analysis, using R, Tableau or any other analysis software)
* Design (making data readable and visually pleasing)
* Maps (geographic data)
* Coding (how to build all this cool stuff)

### You like dags?
Because I like dogs ([you like dags?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXILzUpVx7A)) and data visualization, [here's a data visualization](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/best-in-show-whats-the-top-data-dog/) about dogs from the great Information is Beautiful website to start this blog off with.

Thanks for reading!

Kind regards,
Kenny
