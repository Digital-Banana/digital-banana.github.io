## Welcome!
Welcome to my brief introduction to Data Visualization. In this post I'm going to go over the fundamentals of datavis, starting off with a little history lesson. The fundamentals of datavis can be quite broad, so I'm going to go over the bare essentials. There's a lot of ground to cover here, so I'm going to delve deeper into topics individually in later posts. :)

## What is Data Visualization
In a nutshell: data visualization turns datapoints into visual elements. By placing data in a visual context, it is easier to understand for humans. Certain trends, correlations, or other anomalies suddenly become clear because they are exposed in a visual manner that humans can now comprehend and better understand. As a data visualization guy, I make data available for a wider and bigger audience. That is my goal. Data can be visually encoded by using, among others, spatial position, color, size, shape, and length. The effectiveness depends on whether the data is categorical, ordered or quantitative (more on this later).

> Human beings look for structure, features, patterns, trends, anomalies, and relationships in data. Visualization supports this by presenting data in various forms with differing interactions. A visualization can provide a qualitative overview of large and complex data sets, can summarize data, and can assist in identifying regions of interest and appropriate parameters for more focuses quantitative analysis. 

### Brief history of Data Visualization
We can go back quite far in history. 'Data' has always been around. Landmarks and animals were drawn in caves by our ancestors. An explosion of a supernova -- now known as the Crab Nebula -- thousands of lightyears away was drawn in 1054 AD by an early civilization in what is now New Mexico, USA. Brian Cox [talks about it here](https://youtu.be/6u9YmpCg9bY?t=1020) (if you're into space, the entire presentation is fascinating).

Maps were also drawn. Ptolemy's world map comes to mind. It's a map of the known world according to Hellenic (Greek) society in the second century. Now as time went on, these maps continued to improve. Various European powers mapped a great deal during the 18th century. [Check out this article](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/apr/13/shipping-routes-history-map) by The Guardian that visualises shipping trade routes.

The 18th century was significant for Data Visualization. It was during this century, in 1786, that William Playfair published the first ever timeseries graph (better known as a line chart) in his *Commercial and Political Atlas*. This graph marked the beginning of data visualization as we know it today.

In the second half of the 20th century, French cartographer Jacques Bertin used quantitative graphs to represent information intuitively and show the extent to which it helps people carry out data analysis or communication tasks. Bertin is considered to be one of the most important figures regarding modern data visualization. Well before Edward Tufte, Bertin described the contours of his “Graphic Sign System”, an early framework for designing and evaluating data-based graphics -- effectively laying the foundation for modern data visualization.
